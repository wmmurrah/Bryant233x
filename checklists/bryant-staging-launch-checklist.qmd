This process, executed in the staging area *before* approaching the ramp, ensures a safe, fast, and professional launch.

## 1. Staging Area Prep (The "Dry Run")

**Location:** Perform these steps in the parking lot or staging area, *not* on the ramp.

* [ ] **Confirm Drain Plugs:** Final visual check that **ALL** drain plugs are **IN**.
* [ ] **Disconnect Straps (CRITICAL):**
    * [ ] Remove both **transom ratchet straps**.
    * [ ] Remove the **bow safety chain**.
    * [ ] **LEAVE the bow winch strap** connected and snug. This is now the only thing holding the boat to the trailer.
* [ ] **Load Gear:** Load coolers, bags, and all remaining gear from the F-150 into the boat.
* [ ] **Prep Lines & Fenders:**
    * [ ] Deploy fenders on the "dock side" of the boat.
    * [ ] Have bow and stern dock lines untangled and ready on cleats.
* [ ] **Lower Outdrive (CRITICAL):**
    * [ ] Use the trim switch to **lower the Bravo III outdrive** all the way down (full "in" position).
    * *Note: This is mandatory. The Raw Water Cooled engine needs the drive down to draw water immediately on startup, or the impeller will be destroyed.*
* [ ] **Power On:** Turn the main **battery switch** to the "ON" position.
* [ ] **Blower & Sniff Test (CRITICAL SAFETY STEP):**
    * [ ] Turn key to "ON" (do not start).
    * [ ] Run the **engine bay blower for at least 4-5 minutes.**
    * [ ] **Open the engine hatch and perform a "sniff test"** for any fuel fumes.
* [ ] **Brief Engine Test (Optional, but Recommended):**
    * [ ] *After* the sniff test, start the engine for 5-10 seconds.
    * [ ] Confirm water is "peeing" from the outdrive (verifies water pump).
    * [ ] Shut engine off.
* [ ] **Disconnect Trailer Electrical:** Unplug the **7-to-5-pin adapter** from the F-150. This prevents cold water from cracking hot trailer light bulbs.

## 2. On the Ramp (The "Launch")

This phase should be fast, quiet, and precise.

* [ ] **Communicate:** Confirm the plan with your driver/helper.
* [ ] **Back In:** Slowly back the trailer down the ramp. A good target is when the trailer fenders just start to go underwater or the boat's stern begins to float.
* [ ] **Set Brake (CRITICAL):** Put the F-150 in **Park** and set the **parking brake firmly.**
* [ ] **Board & Start:**
    * [ ] Captain boards the boat.
