## 📞 Call Objective (11/04/2025)

This checklist is to ensure I get complete and accurate quotes for all **Critical Maintenance & To-Do List** items. The goal is to diagnose immediate safety issues and schedule mandatory pre-season replacements.

---

## 1. Core Asset Profile (For Mechanic's Reference)

* **Vessel:** 2013 Bryant 233 X ("Surf Edition")
* **Engine:** Mercruiser 350 MAG (300hp)
* **Cooling:** Raw Water Cooled (RWC)
* **Drive:** Mercruiser Bravo III (Dual-prop)
* **Critical System:** 3-Bag Factory Ballast System (must be winterized)

---

## 2. Primary Service & Quote Items (CRITICAL)

These are the non-negotiable items for the call.

### A. Stiff Steering Diagnosis (Top Priority)

* **Symptom:** "The steering is extremely stiff at the helm, making it difficult to turn the wheel."
* **Diagnostic Ask:** "When you have the boat, please **disconnect the steering cable from the engine's tiller arm** to isolate the problem."
* **Quote Needed:** I need two quotes based on that diagnosis:
    1.  Quote to **replace the steering cable** (if the wheel is still stiff when disconnected).
    2.  Quote to **address the gimbal ring swivel shaft** (if the wheel turns freely and the problem is at the outdrive).

### B. Manifold & Riser Replacement (Mandatory)

* **Job:** "I need a quote to replace the exhaust manifolds and risers. They are the 12-year-old originals and must be replaced before next season."
* **Key Question (Parts):** "Is your quote for **OEM Mercruiser parts** or **aftermarket** (like Barr, Osco, etc.)? I would like to see the price for both if possible."
* **Key Question (Labor):** "Please confirm the quote includes all **new gaskets and mounting bolts**."
* **Quote Needed:** Price for Parts (OEM vs. Aftermarket) + Estimated Labor Hours.

:::{.call-out-note}
**First Mate's Note:** Given our goal of long-term reliability, OEM Mercruiser parts are highly preferred.
:::

### C. Full Winterization

* **Job:** "I need a quote for a complete winterization."
* **Engine Ask:** "What is your process for draining the 350 MAG RWC block and manifolds, and then running marine antifreeze (pink) through?"
* **Ballast Ask (Crucial):** "Crucially, what is your process for fully draining the **3-bag factory ballast system**? This includes all pumps, lines, and bags."
* **Fuel Ask:** "Does your service include adding **marine fuel stabilizer** to the 49-gallon tank and running it through the engine?"
* **Quote Needed:** All-in price for full winterization service.

---

## 3. "While You're At It" (Diagnostics)

"While you have the boat for the winterization and other quotes, please provide a simple diagnosis or check on these items:"

* **Bilge Float Switch (Critical):** "Please test the automatic bilge float switch. It is a primary safety system and its function is unknown."
* **Throttle Cable:** "The throttle is sticking at idle. Can you inspect it, lubricate it, and confirm if the stiffness is in the cable or at the throttle body?"
* **Trailer Tires:** "Please check the 4-digit date codes on all four main trailer tires. They are old, and I need to know their manufacturing date to plan for replacement."
