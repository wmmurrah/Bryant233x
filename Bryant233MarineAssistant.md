## 4. MAINTENANCE LOG (The "Memory")

### 🟢 COMPLETED / RESOLVED
* **Winterization (Nov 2025):** Engine block drained, propylene glycol run through raw water system, ballast pumps drained/cleared.
* **Throttle/Shift Feel:** Confirmed functional. Requires pushing slightly past the detent to engage forward gear. Verified by Jim @ 280 Marine as standard wear/design.
* **Mooring Cover:** Rip patched with Gorilla Tape. Replacement deferred for 1-2 seasons.

### 🟡 PENDING (Quotes/Monitoring)
* **Steering Cable:** *Status: QUOTED.* stiff operation. Needs replacement. Vendor: Jim @ 280 Marine.
* **Trim Gauge:** *Status: QUOTED.* Diagnosis confirmed faulty dashboard gauge (sender is likely fine). Vendor: Jim @ 280 Marine.
* **Manifolds & Risers:** *Status: MONITOR.* Original hardware (12 years old). History is freshwater, so immediate replacement isn't critical, but they are approaching end-of-life.
    * *Action:* Monitor engine temps closely. Plan for "Joint Inspection" (pulling risers to check gasket surfaces) next off-season.

### 🔴 CRITICAL / OUTSTANDING
* **Bilge Float Switch:** *Status: UNKNOWN.* Automatic function must be tested before launch.
* **Trailer Tires:** *Status: INSPECT.* Need to check 4-digit Date Codes on sidewalls. If >6 years old, replace immediately regardless of tread depth.
* **Docking Lights:** *Status: BROKEN.* Starboard light inoperative (bulb confirmed good). Likely a ground/wiring fault behind the fixture.

## 5. OPERATIONAL SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)

### Launch & Retrieval
* **Blower Protocol:** Run blower for minimum 4 minutes before key-turn. Perform "Sniff Test" of bilge.
* **Battery Switch:** Ensure switch is ON before launch.
* **Trailer Depth:** Do not submerge trailer past the fender tops (adjust for ramp steepness).

### Anchoring Strategy (The "No Beaching" Rule)
* **Depth Requirement:** Minimum 4 feet of water under the drive.
* **Method:** Two-Anchor Setup.
    1.  Drop Bow Anchor first upwind/current.
    2.  Back down to set.
    3.  Deploy Stern Anchor to prevent swing.
* **Shore Access:** Ferry passengers and gear using a towable tube or raft.
* **Swimming Safety:** ABSOLUTELY NO swimming near the stern while the engine is running (CO poisoning risk).

### Fueling
* **Procedure:** Engine OFF, Blower ON, all passengers OFF the boat.
* **Additives:** Add STA-BIL 360 *before* pumping fuel to ensure mixing.
