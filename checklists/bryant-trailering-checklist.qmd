A professional, repeatable checklist to ensure safety and prevent common trailering failures. Perform these checks every time.

---

## 1. Pre-Departure (At Home/Storage)

### Boat & Trailer Prep
* [ ] **Drain Plugs:** Confirm **ALL** drain plugs are **IN** (especially the main hull plug).
* [ ] **Outdrive:** Tilt Bravo III outdrive **UP** to "Trailer" position.
* [ ] **Gear:** Secure all loose gear inside boat (cushions, PFDs, covers).
* [ ] **Bimini:** Bimini top is down and secured in its boot.
* [ ] **Bow:** Secure **bow winch strap** AND **bow safety chain**.
* [ ] **Trailer Tongue** Secure folding tongue in towing position.
* [ ] **Stern (CRITICAL):** Secure two (2) **transom ratchet straps** from the trailer frame to the boat's stern tie-down eyes.

### Tires & Spares
* [ ] **Visual Insp.:** Visually inspect 4 trailer tires (cracks, bulges).
* [ ] **Pressure (Trailer):** Check pressure on all 4 trailer tires (Confirm PSI on sidewall, likely **50 PSI** cold).
* [ ] **Pressure (Truck):** Check pressure on F-150's rear tires (adjust for load).
* [ ] **Pressure (Spare):** Check pressure on spare trailer tire.
* [ ] **Spares Kit Loaded:** Confirm spares are in the F-150:
    * [ ] Spare Tire
    * [ ] Trailer-Aid Ramp
    * [ ] **Hub Toolbox** (containing pre-greased hub assemblies, jack, lug wrench, grease gun, and rags).

## 2. Hook-Up (Connecting to F-150)

* [ ] **Hitch:** Lower trailer coupler onto the F-150's **2" ball**.
* [ ] **Latch:** Secure the coupler latch.
* [ ] **Lock:** Insert the **coupler safety pin or lock** (DO NOT FORGET).
* [ ] **Chains:** Connect both safety chains, **crossed in an "X"** under the tongue.
* [ ] **Jack:** Raise the trailer tongue jack *all the way* and swing to its horizontal, stowed position.
* [ ] **Electrical:** 1.  Connect **7-way (truck) to 5-pin (trailer) adapter** to the F-150.
    2.  Connect the trailer's **5-pin flat plug** to the adapter.

## 3. Final Walk-Around (The "Pre-Flight")

### Truck Systems Check (Vehicle On)
* [ ] **Tow Mode:** Activate **"Tow/Haul" Mode** on the F-150 dashboard.
* [ ] **Lights:** Test running lights, brake lights, and both turn signals.
* [ ] **Reverse Lockout (CRITICAL):** Foot on brake, shift F-150 to **Reverse**. Listen for an audible **"CLICK"** from the trailer tongue. This is the 5th-pin solenoid engaging.
    * *No click? Your surge brakes will lock when you try to reverse. Stop and diagnose the 7-to-5 adapter or wiring.*

### Final Securement Check (Walk-Around)
* [ ] Coupler latched and pinned?
* [ ] Chains crossed?
* [ ] Electrical plugged in?
* [ ] Trailer jack up?
* [ ] Transom straps tight?
* [ ] Bow strap & chain tight?
* [ ] Outdrive tilted UP?
* [ ] Nothing loose in boat or truck bed?
* [ ] Spares kit loaded?
* [ ] All chocks, charging cords removed

## 4. On-the-Road Procedure

* **Drive Defensively:** You are 5,000+ lbs heavier. Make wide turns and **double** your normal stopping distance.
* **First 30-Minute Stop (CRITICAL):**
    * Pull over at a safe location (rest stop, gas station).
    * Carefully feel all 4 trailer wheel hubs. They should be warm, but **NEVER so hot you can't hold your hand on them.**
    * *(A "screaming hot" hub = bearing failure is imminent).*
    * Re-check transom and bow straps for tightness.
